# likeness-swift
Likeness might one day be a photo-finding and archiving tool, but right now I am just playing around with Swift.

This is a re-implementation of a [Go sandbox](https://github.com/werkshy/likeness) I have been playing with which itself is a re-implementation of a few python scripts I had up and running a few years ago.
